Prerequisites.
Install json-server is used to prototype and mock a backend server.
Using the command:

$ npm install -g json-server

### run the worker.js directly with json-server:

http://localhost:3000/publications 

### to run the server on your browser to see the resources:

### to run the angular app on the browser 

$ ng serve --open

http://localhost:4200 


*NOTE.
I was not able to finish it and do all you require. This is the first time I work with Angular and TypeScript. I went from 0 to this. I did my best, however it was not enough time to learn and apply a new language in 5 days. I am happy. I got to learn a lot and will continue practicing with Angular. 
Please let me know if you have further questions. 
Thanks.
