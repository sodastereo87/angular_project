# angular_project

Prerequisites.
Install json-server is used to prototype and mock a backend server.
Using the command:

\$ npm install -g json-server

### run the worker.js directly with json-server:

\$ json-server workers.js

http://localhost:3000/publications

### to run the server on your browser to see the resources:

\$ npm run mock:api

http://localhost:4000/users
http://localhost:4000/companies

### to run the angular app on the browser

\$ ng serve --open

http://localhost:4200

\*NOTE.
I was not able to do all that you require. I Just missed a few things. This is the first time I work with Angular and TypeScript. I went from 0 to this. I did my best and went the closest to what you need, however it was not enough time to learn and apply a new language in 5 days. No matter what, I am happy cause I loved this new challenge. I got to learn a lot and will continue practicing with Angular.
Please let me know if you have further questions.
Thanks.
